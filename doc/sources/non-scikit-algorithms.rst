Non-Scikit-Learn Algorithms
===========================
Algorithms not presented in the original scikit-learn are described here. All algorithms are
available for both CPU and GPU (including distributed mode).

.. Note::
    If using :ref:`patching <patching>`, these classes can be imported either from module ``sklearn``
    or from module ``sklearnex``.
